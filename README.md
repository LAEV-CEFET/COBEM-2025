This repository contains the complete experimental tests results partially presented in "Vibration analysis and resonance in machines assembled on Flexible support: An Experimental And Computational Approach" submitted to the 28 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS
OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING (COBEM 2025).

The file "SPRING2" contains the vibration readings (excel file) of the experimental bench with the spring 2 set.
the file columns follow the following order: Time in seconds; Vibration collected by the PCB accelerometer at position 1 in the X direction (PCB1X); PCB1-Z; PCB1Y; PCB3X; PCB3(-Z); PCB3Y; MEMS1X; MEMS1(-Z); MEMS1Y;

A Video of one vibration mode is shown inthe file "Vib. mode rotation in Z.mp4"
